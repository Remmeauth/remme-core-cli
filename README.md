## Getting started

<h3 id="getting-started-requirements">Requirements</h4>

- Python 3.6 or 3.7 — install one of them with the [following reference](https://www.python.org/downloads).

### Installation

Install the package from the [PypI](https://pypi.org/project/remme-core-cli) through [pip](https://github.com/pypa/pip):

```bash
$ pip3 install remme-core-cli
```

## Usage

### Service

Get the version of the package — ``remme --version``:

```bash
$ remme --version
remme, version 0.1.0
```

Get all possible package's commands — ``remme --help``:

```bash
$ remme --help
Usage: remme [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  Command line interface for PyPi version checking.

Options:
  --version  Show the version and exit.
  --help     Show this message and exit.

...
```

### Account

Get balance of the account by its address — ``remme account get-balance``:

| Arguments | Type   |  Required | Description                                         |
| :-------: | :----: | :-------: | --------------------------------------------------- |
| address   | String |  Yes      | Get balance of the account by its address.          |
| node-url  | String |  No       | Apply the command to the specified node by its URL. |

```bash
$ remme account get-balance \
      --address=1120076ecf036e857f42129b58303bcf1e03723764a1702cbe98529802aad8514ee3cf \
      --node-url=node-genesis-testnet.remme.io
368440.0
```

## Development

<h3 id="development-requirements">Requirements</h4>

- Docker — https://www.docker.com. Install it with the [following reference](https://docs.docker.com/install).

### Docker

Clone the project and move to project folder:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Remmeauth/remme-core-cli && cd remme-core-cli
```

If you already worked with the project, you can clean it's container and images with the following command:

```bash
$ docker rm remme-core-cli -f || true && docker rmi remme-core-cli -f || true
```

Run the ``Docker container`` with the project source code in the background mode:

```bash
$ docker build -t remme-core-cli . -f Dockerfile.development
$ docker run -d -v $PWD:/remme-core-cli --name remme-core-cli remme-core-cli
```

Enter the container bash:

```bash
$ docker exec -it remme-core-cli bash
```

And now being in the container, you can develop the project. For instance, run tests and linters:

```bash
$ pytest tests/
$ flake8 cli && flake8 tests/
```

When you have developed new functionality, check it with the following command. This command creates the ``Python package``
from source code instead of installing it from the ``PyPi``.

```bash
$ pip3 uninstall -y remme-core-cli && rm -rf dist/ remme_core_cli.egg-info && \
      python3 setup.py sdist && pip3 install dist/*.tar.gz
```

So after this command, you are free to execute the command line interface as if you installed in through ``pip3 install``:

```bash
$ remme --version
```

With the commands above you could test your features as if user will use it on own.

```bash
$ docker rm $(docker ps -a -q) -f
$ docker rmi $(docker images -q) -f
```

## Production

To build the package and upload it to [PypI](https://pypi.org) to be accessible through [pip](https://github.com/pypa/pip),
use the following commands. [Twine](https://twine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) requires the username and password of the
account package is going to be uploaded to.

```build
$ python3 setup.py sdist
$ twine upload dist/*
username: remme
password: ********
```

## Contributing

Clone the project and install requirements:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Remmeauth/remme-core-cli && cd remme-core-cli
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
$ pip3 install -r requirements-dev.txt
$ pip3 install -r requirements-tests.txt
```

When you will make changes, ensure your code pass [the checkers](https://github.com/Remmeauth/remme-core-cli/blob/develop/.travis.yml#L16) and is covered by tests using [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest).
